      <h3>Kanye West as an artist</h3>
      <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kanye_West"><img src="kanyewest.jpg" alt="Kanye West"></a>
      <p> Kanye West is a hip-hop artist based out of Chicago, Illinois. He is widely considered the best producer of all time and also considered by many to be at least top 5 in rappers of all time. He earned this reputation by winning 21 Grammys and has been nominated for 68. These accolades seperate his art from the fact that he is ofgten scrutinized by mainstream media fro his antics. He is also credited for transitioning mainstream hip-hop for gangsta rap to a sound that is more appelaing to the masses who do not normally listen to rap. For these reasons Kanye West is personally my favorite rapper of all time, due to his ability to masterfully craft songs because he is both the artist and the producer allowing him to have full creative power over his art. </p>
